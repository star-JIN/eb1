    <h2>진리란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p>In Roman mythology, Veritas, meaning truth, is the goddess of truth, a daughter of Chronos, the God of Time (who has been identified with Saturn-Cronus, perhaps first by Plutarch), and the mother of Virtus. She is also sometimes considered the daughter of Zeus,[1] or a creation of Prometheus.[2][3] It was believed that she hid in the bottom of a holy well because she was so elusive. Her image is shown as a young virgin dressed in white.[4]</p>
